1:  Find Opposing Force's install directory. 
    On Steam: Right Click on Opposing Force in your library 
    and click "Browse local files" (op4_1.jpg)
2:  Find the "gearbox" folder and copy it. 
    Then paste it into the same folder (op4_2.jpg)
3:  Rename the folder as "spirinityop4" (op4_3.jpg)
4:  Extract content of the "spirinop4diff.rar" 
    into the directory that you just renamed
    replace all files when asked (op4_4.jpg)
5:  Restart Steam and find the "Spirinity: OP4 Edition"
    then press play button.

I suggest playing on Windowed mode with "Borderless mode"
activated from advanced settings.

If you have option errors, you can exec spirinity_default.cfg

Grayscale system is a bit buggy. So if it get broken, disabling and re-enabling it
should fix the problems

Because of legal reasons, I cannot give OP4 files to you.
So I will only send required mod files that you should manually patch.

Have a good playthrough!
