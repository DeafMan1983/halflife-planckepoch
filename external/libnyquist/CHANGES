Updated libvorbis to libvorbis-1.3.7

Converted ConvertFromFloat32 function into a templated one

Small code wise changes can be found as "// CHANGE - Fran:"
Here is a lsit of them anyway:

floor1.c - Renamed FLOOR1_fromdB_LOOKUP as FLOOR1_fromdB_LOOKUP_RE for conflict reasons.
codebook.c - Renamed bitreverse as bitreverse_re for conflict reasons.
